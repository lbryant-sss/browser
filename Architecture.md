# Software Architecture for Simple Browser Application

## Components:

1. **Frontend Interface (Tkinter GUI):**
   - Handles user interaction through a graphical interface.
   - Includes elements such as the address bar, navigation buttons, and display area for web content.
   - *Status: Implemented*
   - *Technology: Tkinter (Python GUI library)*

2. **Backend Logic:**
   - Manages the core functionality of the browser application.
   - Responsible for processing user input, handling navigation requests, and fetching web content.
   - *Status: Implemented*
   - *Technology: Python*

3. **Database Integration (MongoDB):**
   - Stores browser history and bookmarks.
   - Allows for retrieval and management of saved data.
   - *Status: Yet to be implemented (Unfinished)*
   - *Technology: MongoDB*

4. **Conversion to .exe:**
   - Utilizes tools such as PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to convert Python scripts into standalone executable files.
   - Ensures that the application can be easily installed and run on Windows machines without requiring Python to be installed.
   - *Status: Yet to be implemented (Unfinished)*
   - *Technology: PyInstaller, cx_Freeze*

## Interaction Flow:

1. **User Interaction:**
   - User interacts with the frontend interface, enters URLs in the address bar, and navigates through web pages using buttons.

2. **Frontend-Backend Interaction:**
   - Frontend components trigger actions in the backend logic based on user input.
   - Backend logic processes requests, fetches web content using libraries like `requests`, and updates the display area with the fetched content.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Backend logic interacts with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve browser history and bookmarks.
   - Upon navigation to a new page or bookmarking a page, relevant data is saved or updated in the database.

4. **Conversion to .exe:**
   - After development and testing, the Python scripts are converted into a standalone executable file using a suitable tool.
   - The resulting .exe file can be distributed and installed on Windows PCs without requiring Python or additional dependencies.

## Considerations:

1. **Scalability:** Ensure that the architecture can accommodate future enhancements and features, such as tabbed browsing or advanced bookmark management.

2. **Security:** Implement measures to protect user data stored in the MongoDB database and ensure secure communication between frontend and backend components.

3. **Performance:** Optimize database queries and application logic to maintain responsiveness and efficiency, especially when handling large amounts of data.

4. **User Experience:** Design the frontend interface to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing clear navigation options and feedback to the user.
